I wanted to try out [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) without writing another TODO app.
So, Bitcoin clicker was born. It's a browser game with the objective to become the biggest Bitcoin miner! :rocket:

## Gameplay

The player starts bitcoin mining back in 2013.
Purchase and deployment of mining hardware as well
as technological research is required to stay
competitive in the market.
Mined coins need to be sold to cover rent and utility bills.

## Current State

The game is in early development. The foundation is
done, yet intuitive UI and story telling mechanics
are still missing in action.

I'm grateful for your constructive feedback! :speech_balloon:
