# Once upon a time

The game starts in 2013.

The player becomes absorbed with the concept of bitcoin and
immerses himself in this auspicious but also vague world.

## Chapter 1

The player starts learning about mining.
While researching how to get started with mining,
he figures that he can also trade coins in the meantime.

### Basic Mining Tech Tree

1. Fundamentals of Mining
   1. Buy computer (low, mid, high)
   1. Basic Computer Skills
      1. Install Miner (cpu miner)
         1. Start Mining
      1. Advanced Computer skills
         1. Prevent automatic standby
         1. Tweak miner configuration
         1. Overclock CPU
         1. Pro Computer skills
            1. Improve CPU-mining software
            1. Develop GPU mining
               1. Buy PC (with 1x GPU)
               1. Improve GPU-mining algorithm
               1. Overclock GPU
               1. Develop multi GPU support (2x, 3x, ...)
                  1. Buy GPU
                  1. Develop RIG design
                     => [end of basic mining]

At the beginning, the player has space for up to 5 PCs with each 4 GPUs

Electricity costs are relevant!

### Basic Trading Tech Tree

1. Register at local bitcoins
   1. Create buy offer
      1. Personally execute trade
   1. Create sell offer
      1. Personally execute trade
1. Use online exchange (after time 2013 ?)
   1. Buy coins
   1. Sell coins
   1. FIAT crypto arbitrage
      1. Buy low & send coins (fast)
      1. Sell high & wire money (slow)
      1. Crypto crypto arbitrage (after time x)
         1. Buy low & send coins (fast)
         1. Sell high & send coins (fast)
         1. Develop arbitrage bot (req: Pro Computer skills ?)  
            => [end of basic trading]

After completing both basic mining and basic trading, the
player unlocks the next stage.

## Chapter 2

The player is now self sustained by his crypto ventures.
Next steps will be to build his first mining farm and
taping into other blockchain business cases.

### Farm Tech Tree

Buildout:
1. Rent Space (Barren, Hall, Datacenter)
   1. Deploy RIG
   1.
   1. Repair broken HW
1. Advanced RIG design
   1. reduce hardware cost
   1. improve hashrate
   1. reduce electricity consumption
   1. improve GPU capacity (5, 6, 8*, 10**)
   1. improve durability
1. Basic shelf layout (improve space usage)
   1. Deploy shelf
   1. Denser shelf layout
   1. Improve Farm layout (efficient deployment)
      1. controlled airflow (improves cooling)
      1. Install particle filter (reduces HW damage)

Supply Chain:
* Bargain better HW prices (many tiers)
* Bargain better Electricity prices (many tiers)
* Purchase larger volumes to reduce price
*
